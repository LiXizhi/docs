    <p>The Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE) is composed of the 100-year-old Summerhill School group, the 50-year-old Sudbury Valley School group, and a large number of learning centers originated from them. The organization is dedicated to make Self-Directed Education available to everyone who seeks it. Self-Directed Education, with comprehensive practical system of theory and methodology, has weathered the test of time. Open Source Learning (OSL) is the contact organization of Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE) in China, making a long-term commitment to the popularization of Self-Directed Education. KeepWork, a self-learning platform embedded with Knowledge Engine powered for Open Source Learning, accords with Self-Directed Education put forward by Open Source Learning. Introducing the self-directed learning mode from the Sudbury Valley School group and Summerhill School group, KeepWork is dedicated to making students develop self-learning abilities as well as systematic thinking abilities and good learning habits.</p>

            <strong>Xizhi Li,</strong>
           born in1982 in Harbin, got a bachelor's degree in computer science from Zhejiang University (Chu Kochen Honors College) in 2005. In the same year, he founded ParaEngine distributed game engine developement studio and published 8 papers and books on game engine, scripting language technology, 3D animation production, CPU chip design in domestic and foreign conferenced and publications. In 2007, with the investment from IDG, and American investment fund, and a famous domestic IT entrepreneur, he founded Shenzhen ParaEngine Technology Co. Ltd and became the CEO. Then from 2016, combing his self-learning experience in the childbood, he began to get engaged in opening up the game engines and ecological softwares he developed and building a self-learning platform, with the prospect of helping China turn out brilliant computer programmers and guiding more kids how to learn by themselves efficiently.
       Xizhi has a lot of practical experience in teaching children programming. And combing more than 30 years' programming experience since the age of 7, he has a deep and comprehensive thinking on how children learn programming. Paracraft, the ecological environment for programming learning, is developed based on his research. And the mentor service is also an important experience in his early learning of programming.
